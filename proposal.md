# Proposal
For the major-project in CS30 I am going to create an arcade-style game called "Jump". In which the player controls a character that moves constantly to the right of the screen. The player's goal is to navigate the character across the screen while trying to avoid the obstacles placed at random locations(on the ground and in the air) by "jumping". In the end, the player will receive a message that shows for how long has the player survived(in seconds), which will then act as the player's score.
-----------------------------------Inspired by "Flappy Bird" and "Jumping Dino"----------------------------------------

## Need To Have List
#### GamePlay
- Player controlled character/object.
  * Being able to change the colour of the character
- Score Keeping(for how long has the player survived).
- Land and air obstacles(in different sizes and shapes).

#### Player Experience(UI)
(Hints and Messages to guide player whenever needed)
- Start Screen
  * Colour Change Option
  * Start Button
  
- Music
  * Menu music(Start Screen)
  * Background music(in game)
  * GameOver music(Game end)
  
- Sound Effects
  * Jumping(for player controlled character/object)
  * Clicking on buttons(in Start Screen and GameOver Screen)
  * Death sound effect(when player loses the game)

- GameOver Screen
  * Restart button


## Nice To Have
- Two-player mode.
- Upgrades or Power-Ups for the character.
- Add in collectable objects(such as coins).
