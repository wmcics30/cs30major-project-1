# Proposal
For the major-project in CS30 I am going to create an arcade-style game called "Jump". In which the player controls a character that moves constantly to the right of the screen. The player's goal is to navigate the character across the screen while trying to avoid the obstacles placed at random locations(on the ground and in the air) by "jumping". By the end, the player will receive a message that shows for how long he has survived(in seconds).

## Need To Have List
- Player controlled character/object.
- Score Keeping - for how long the player has survived.
- Land and air obstacles.


## Nice To Have
- Two-player mode.
- Upgrades or Power-Ups for the character.
- Add in collectable objects(such as coins).
