# Reflection - David(Zihan) Yang

## 1. Did you complete everything in your "needs to have" list?
* The answer is Yes. Fortunately, I was able to complete all of the components under the "need to have" list even during the unprecedented schedule due to COVID-19. In the beginning, I had worries about if there was enough to finish the "need to have" list, considering we had very limited work time. Though in the end, everything worked out smoothly and I was able to include everything in the "need to have" list.

## 2. What was the hardest part of the project?
* After reflecting on the project, there were two challenges that I had to face. Firstly, creating the animation of the dinosaur and bird. Secondly, implementing the collision detection. Animating the characters was very difficult when I first started since p5js does not support a great way to include .gif in the code. Therefore, in the end, I learned that you could simply switch constantly between two images/frames to create a short animated object. By using an imgArray and modulo I was able to create the animation. Collision detection was another obstacle when building this project. As the images and obstacles in the game have different shapes and sizes, it was challenging to find a way to incorporate everything. Using rectangles and circles as collision detection was again quite unachievable with the time provided for the project. Fortunately, after taking in Mr. Schellenberg's advice, I was able to get the collision detection working by creating a smaller "hit-box" compared to the actual image. 

### 3. Were there any problems you could not solve?
* I managed to solve most of the problems encountered during the project using the knowledge taught in class. Although, the items in the "nice to have" list did get me some trouble. Especially with the collectable objects. 
I just couldn't get it to work after many tries. I couldn't find a way to include gravity and at the same time use collision.  I hope in the future after I learn more physics, I can include that in my project.
